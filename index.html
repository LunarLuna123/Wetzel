ABOUT Wetzel
</div>
Young Wetzel is a timid boy. Though being mute, he brings a wipe board and markers he wears around his neck to communicate. The reason for this is unknown, he will not talk about it. It is common for him to hide from others as he feels nervous around older campers. One way for you to get him to like you is to give him strawberries. He just loves strawberries. <br><br>It is impossible for him to avoid apologizing for anything, even things that are not his fault. There may be times when it seems like he is not completely present, but it is just because he is often daydreaming. He often carries his turtle Walter in his front pocket. He likes to collect buttons and has a box full of them under his bunk. Before moving to camp half-blood he lived with his mother, step father and younger sister Gracie until 'something' happened and he was sent away immediately. <br><br>
                Likes: Strawberries, Walter, Drawing, Tic Tac Toe, His Board, Ice Pops, Buttons, Dancing
                <br>
                Dislikes: Bikes, Bullies, Pears, Mountain lions, Green Beans, Lint<br><br>

PERSONALITY
</div>

Wetzel is very shy. He feels nervous around older campers, almost terrified. He is very aplogetic, apologizing for anything, even things that are not his fault. There may be times when it seems like he is not completely present, but it is just because he is often daydreaming. He does not like using his powers, and would rather not have any confrontation at all.

HISTORY
</div>

Wetzel Cornelius Ubel was conceived in what most people would consider an unlikely set of circumstances and events. It all began when Emily Ubel, a sophomore in uni, was invited to out to a club. She didn’t even like the people that had invited her, she just wanted to get drunk and/or high to forget about her ex. Such an bitch. She put on her tightest clothes and left with a group of people she barely knew and despised to a club that she had never been to. It was probably the worst place she had ever been. <br> <br><img src="https://www.deadline.ru/data/cache/2022feb/17/10/1792585_14258-543x0.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;margin-left:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"> The alcohol was watered down and they played music she had never even heard of. It was such limited setlist that the same songs were repeated over and over until they’re permanently ingrained into her head, turning what’s supposed to be entertainment into a form of torture. After an hour of sober dancing to the worst music ever she decided to ditch the group and just go back to the dorms. She was going to call an Uber however when she went outside she realized her phone was dead. Well no it wasn’t ‘dead’ not until she took it out of her bra. It blinked 1% and then proceeded to die. It started to pour down ruining her hair and make up. She saw a mom and pop’s diner still open across the street, however Emily wasn’t bright enough to walk. No, she had to haul ass breaking her heels as she did.<br><br>  

“Son of a bitch!” 
<br><br>
She walked the rest of the way to the mom and pop’s diner to ask to charge her phone in one of the booths. She had to buy a coffee but they allowed her.  There wasn’t really anyone in the diner, a server or two, a woman who seemed to have worked too late. Emily looked a mess, she had to take off her useless heels and her curled hair now fell flat against her face making her look like Samara Morgan. She sighed leaning back as she waited for her phone to charge to a reasonable 20%. 
<br><br>

“Hello”
<br><br>

She looked up to see a handsome looking man with an amused smile looking down at her.
<br><br>

“What the fuck do you want?” She snapped.
<br><br>

“I had a bad pick up line but it seems you don’t want to hear it…I had a bad day. You look like you had one. Let's you and I try to make it a better one.”
<br><br>

Silence went on for a couple of minutes before Emily burst into laughter.
<br><br>

<img src="https://northerncafeandgrill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7623ca30-5c23-477e-81dd-fbf975352e5b-1024x682.jpg" style="height:200px;float:left;margin-right:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
“That was the pick up line wasn’t it?”
<br><br>


“Was it really that obvious?” He said, rubbing his neck.
<br><br>

He began to sit down but halted looking at her for permission.
<br><br>

“Fuck it. Go ahead, you may pass.” She said, erupting in more laughter. “So what made your day shitty?” She asked, leaning back once again.
<br><br>

“You see I work with my brothers and they are such dicks! They like to tell me how I should run my department. It’s like this is not your area of expertise, stick your nose somewhere else. And then I met a woman a few days ago, we totally hit it off. Then before anything could happen. Bam! She dumped me.”  He sat down bewildered.
<br><br>

“Oh I understand you just want ‘you know’.” Emily smirked at him
<br><br>

“Before you say anything, I was very upfront about it.” 
<br><br>


“Uh huh.”
<br><br>

“Friends with benefits, benefits everyone.”
<br><br>

Emily snorted at him.
<br><br>

“What about you?” He asked, rolling his eyes.
<br><br>

“My ex dumped me on my birthday, she’s a real ass, that was last week. That’s what I get for dating a hooters girl. I’m failing all my classes. Yay me! All I wanted to do was get high, drunk, party a little and take an unsuspecting guy back to my dorm and do him. I guess I’m a failure at that too.” She groaned. “Life is so difficult!” 
<br><br>

“Hmm well, not to be that guy…but we both can solve a bit of our problems rather quickly.”
<br><br>

“What if you are a murder?” She stared at him.
<br><br>

“What if you are?
<br><br>

They laid in her bed in her dorm. Thankfully her roommate was with her boyfriend cause then they would have had to be really creative.
<br><br>
“What’s your name by the way?” She asked as she went to grab her stash.
<br><br>
“Carlos.” He said in a Latin accent, a bad one.
<br><br>
She side eyed him. 
<br><br>
“No it’s not..you couldn't have thought about a better fake name.”
<br><br>
“Well what’s yours?”
<br><br>
“Sabrina Lovett.” She said, dramatically jumping back on the bed.
<br><br>
“That is better.”
<br><br>
“See.” She laughed, she showed him a blunt. “Want one?”
<br><br>
“....Sure.”
<br><br>
The room was so smokey, the next person who walked in could have gotten a contact high.
<br><br>
“Hey, I have a question?” He asked.
<br><br>
“What?”
<br><br>
His eyes landed on her desk with a disc of birth control pills.
<br><br>
“Nevermind.”
<br><br>

<br><br>

“Fuck!Fuck!Fuck!Fuck!Fuck!Fuck!Fuck!!!!!” Emily shouted as she waited, waving the pink stick in her hand.
<br><br>
“You need to calm down.” Alyssa said as she watched Emily pace back and forth.
<br><br><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/cosmouk.cdnds.net/cm/14/30/53d51d543bcfa_-_positive-pregnancy-test.jpg?resize=280:*" style="height:200px;float:left;margin-right:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"><br><br>
“Don’t tell me to calm down. I can’t take care of our mutual dorm plant, let alone a baby!” 
<br><br>
Alyssa shook her head as she watched her roommate and friend pace back and forth.
<br><br><br><br>

“What are you going to do? If you are.” She asked.
<br><br>

Emily paused and fell to the bed. She looked to the floor, fidgeting with the test.
<br><br>

“I don’t know. I can’t keep it right? I would be a horrible mother…”
<br><br>

“You can put it up for adoption.” Alyssa said sitting next to her.
<br><br>

“No, that’s not an option. I was part of the system, I hated it.”
<br><br>

She looked at the test again. Two lines.
<br><br>

“Maybe you should call Katherine”
<br><br>

“I’m not calling that psycho bitch”
<br><br>

“She is technically your mother.”
<br><br>
“No, she is someone who bought me. Because she was sad.”
<br><br>

“Alright well then what?”
<br><br>

“....Just give me my phone.”
<br><br>

_____________________________________________________________________
<br><br>

“What do you mean you're pregnant?!” A woman's shrill voice is heard from the other end of the cell.
<br><br>

“It’s not like I planned this.”
<br><br>

“We sent you to get a good education, to have a good life, not to get yourself knocked up!”<br><br>

<img src="https://image1.masterfile.com/getImage/NjkzLTA2NDAzNDIxZW4uMDAwMDAwMDA=AIjFmV/693-06403421en_Masterfile.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;margin-left:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
Emily allowed her adoptive mother to brate her as Alyssa held her hand for encouragement.
<br><br>

“I don’t even know if I'm even going to keep it.”
<br><br>

“Oh you definitely are not! Emily Ubel, you will not keep that child. Its father was probably a druggie. You would be a terrible mother anyway!-”
<br><br>

“Katherine, give me the phone!” Emily heard her adoptive father snach the phone from Katherine.
<br><br>

He gave a long sigh as Emily heard Katherine stomp away.
<br><br>

“Hi Em.”
<br><br>

“Hi.”
<br><br>

“Sorry, she is… the way she is.” He spoke gently. “This is your decision and whatever you choose I will support you one hundred percent. I want you to be happy and whatever choice that will help you achieve that i’m all for.”
<br><br>

“Thanks dad.”
<br><br>
“Always.”

Emily ended the call and looked over to Alyssa.
<br><br>

“Why is he still with that woman? She’s such a bitch.”
<br><br>

“I’m gonna keep it.”
<br><br>

“What?”
<br><br>

“I want it. Them. I want my baby. I want to love it.”
<br><br>

Alyssa hugged Emily tightly.<br><br>

_______________________________________________________________________<br><br>


Emily sat down at the library looking at any baby books she could find. She needed to be prepared for anything. She suddenly was poked in the back of the head. If she wasn’t five months pregnant she would have beaten the man.
<br><br>

She recognized him as her friend Bryce Wyatt. Her friend from childhood.<br><br>
<img src="https://cdn2.momjunction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Pregnant-Belly-Size-Chart-And-Shape-1-910x1024.jpg" style="height:200px;float:left;margin-right:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

“Hi!” 
<br><br>
“Asshole! Don’t sneak up on pregnant women!”
<br><br>
The librarian shushed them, and was soon met with four middle fingers back.
<br><br>
“Right, you're pregnant! Congrats, you missy are the talk of town back home.”<br><br>

“Gossiping bitches.”
<br><br>
“Hey! One of those bitches happens to be my mother.” He laughed sitting next to her. “So is it a boy or a girl?”
<br><br>


“I don’t know. This book says that if that baby's heart rate is fast it's a girl, but this one says if my belly is thick around the edges it's a boy and doctors say it's either a boy with a tiny dinky or an odd shaped girl. All I know is it has a hankering for soft pretzels and it's making me fat and emotional!” Emily said bursting into tears.
<br><br><img src="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/001/816/963/large_2x/piles-of-books-on-a-table-over-a-blurred-library-background-free-photo.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;margin-left:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
Bryce hugged his friend trying to console her. However in the end the librarian had the last laugh, getting security and kicking them out. Banning Emily in the process. 
<br><br>
“That's sexist.”
<br><br>

“You were the one crying and causing a scene.” Bryce chuckled.
<br><br>

“Well now what do I do? I can’t afford to buy baby books.”
<br><br>

“Well since I’m not banned I could rent them for you…gives me an excuse to come visit.”
<br><br>
Emily punched his shoulder. “Good! It’s your fault anyway. Now drive me back to my dorms please.”<br><br>

She walked down the parking lot, her face blushing red.<br><br>
_______________________________________________________________________<br><br>
<h5 style="margin:0;font-family:courier new,monospace;font-size:9px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-align:right;">Baby Wetzel</h5><br><br>
“That’s a unique choice.” Alyssa said as she, Emily, Bryce and her boyfriend Charlie stood staring at the small baby lying asleep on the bed.
<img src="https://images.whattoexpect.com/78332b46-88a0-4ad3-85cf-81a9c198c3a0" style="height:200px;float:left;margin-right:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"><br><br>

“Wetzel…I like it!” Bryce said.
<br><br>
He leaned over the baby making cooing noises.
<br><br>
“Hi Wetzel, I’m your mommy’s boyfriend.”
<br><br>
“We never agreed to that yet.” Emily said, rolling her eyes.
<br><br>
Alyssa smirked at her.
<br><br>
“He's still on a trial run.”
<br><br><br><br>

There was a knock on the dormitory door. Alyssa went over and opened it. It was their dorm manager.
<br><br>

“Hi Lisa.”
<br><br>

“I am the manager, not a mail carrier. This is for Emily.” She said, handing an envelope to Alyssa before rolling her eyes and walking off.
<br><br>

“Bitch.” Alyssa slammed the door, handing the envelope to Emily. 
<br><br>

Emily took the letter reading the outside name.
<br><br>

Bryce looked over her shoulder. “Who the hell is Carlos?”
<br><br>

<h5 style="margin:0;font-family:courier new,monospace;font-size:9px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-align:right;">Toddler Wetzel</h5><br><br>
“Wetzel Cornelius Ubel! You get your ass back in the bath right now!” Emily said, chasing the three naked wet three year old down the hall of the dormitory.
<br><br>


“Go Wetzel!” The residents yelled as the boy ran from his mother.
<br><br>

<img src="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/04/72/79/54/360_F_472795482_7ptQqQWkiB5OuD8DOUUxcUryVyNXDEiY.jpg" style="height:200px;float:right;margin-left:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"><br><br>

“None of you are helping the situation!” She shouted as the boy slipped through her hands once again.
<br><br>

“Can’t catch me, can’t catch me!” Wetzel repeated until he was snatched up by one of his favorite people.<br><br>
<br><br>

“Gotta little man.”
<br><br>

“Papa! Put me down!” He said, biting Bryce’s arm as he threw the boy over his shoulder.
<br><br>

Bryce almost dropped him from the pain of the bite.
<br><br>

“Hey, Sharky, you bite me again. We’ll have to sand down your teeth.” He carried the boy over to his mother.
<br><br>

“And I might let him.” Emily said looking exhausted. 
<br><br>

Bryce kissed her on the head. He held Wetzel in front of his mother, allowing the boy to kiss her too.
<br><br>

“Aawweee!” The dormitory cooed. 
<br><br>

“Shut up! Get him inside please.”
<br><br>

“As you wish my lady. Let's go Sharky!”
<br><br>

“Wee!” Wetzel giggled as he was supermaned back to the bath.<br><br>

<h5 style="margin:0;font-family:courier new,monospace;font-size:9px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-align:right;">Birth Of Baby Grace</h5><br><br>

“She’s so teeny tiny!” Wetzel said, looking down at the small baby in his mothers arms.<br><br>

<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/74/b5/69/74b5692e19d4a8c84cd3d1749de3bac0.jpg" style="height:200px;float:left;margin-right:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
“She is. You were that tiny once.”
<br><br>
“Nuh uh.”
<br><br>

“Uh huh.” Emily laughed, pulling Wetzel to her other arm. “My two babies.”<br><br>

“What’s her name?” Wetzel asked.
<br><br>
“Annie.”  Bryce chuckled.
<br><br>
“No it’s not.” Emily said glaring.
<br><br>
“That's a great name, plus it's like a pattern. Annie and Wetzel both famous soft pretzel places.”
<br><br>
“No!”
<br><br>
“You ruin all my fun.” He pouted.
<br><br>
“Her name is Grace.”
<br><br>
“Hi baby Grace! I’m your big brother. I’m gonna take care of you and love you! We're going to be bestest friends!”<br><br>

_______________________________________________________________________<br><br>
<h5 style="margin:0;font-family:courier new,monospace;font-size:9px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-align:right;">The Incedent</h5><br><br>



“Nooo bad Gracie! Don’t touch my drawings!” Wetzel yelled at his little sister pushing her away.
<br><br>
Grace screamed from the top of her lungs.
<br><br>
Emily rocked Grace to settle her down. “Wetzel stop it right now.  Gracie is still little, she doesn’t understand.”<br><br>
<img src="https://www.howwemontessori.com/.a/6a0147e1d4f40f970b0240a4724d3a200c-pi" style="height:200px;float:right;margin-left:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"><br><br>
Emily watched as Grace pulled off her cochlear implant and tossed it across the room, apparently sick of all the noise.<br><br>

“Honey I can reschedule if you want me too. I really don’t want to tattoo this man’s ass today anyway.”
<br><br>
“No, it's fine. Just make sure you come back home on time. I have to meet Alice and Frank to discuss their shitty spending habits.” Emily said kissing Bryce goodbye.
<br><br>
“Best accountant in all of Philadelphia.” He said before kissing her back and walking out of their average sized apartment.
<br><br>
“I hate it here! Grace is stupid!” He said, throwing a tantrum.
<br><br>

“Wetzel.” She groaned, placing Grace in her playpen and going to pick him up.
<br><br>

Wetzel became dead weight, refusing to make it easy for his mother. Emily gave up after a minute. 
<br><br>

“How about food? I have strawberries. Oooo” She said, running to the kitchen.
<br><br>

“I don’t want strawberries! You like Gracie more than me!” Wetzel cried.
<br><br>

“I do not Wetzel! You are being dramatic, Gracie is a baby. And she needs a little extra care.” Emily shouted back.
<br><br>

“I hate you! You're an asshole! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!”
<br><br>

She walked back into the living room and caught his hand. She didn’t mean to shout nor be as aggressive as she was but she was very overwhelmed today and Wetzel was just making everything more difficult. 
<br><br>


“Now go to your room! You better not be in there when I get back to the living room!” Emily shouted back.
 <br><br>

Wetzel went silent as his mother walked back into the kitchen. He frowned then glared at his little sister. 
<br><br>

He walked over to her in her pen.
<br><br>

“I hate you. I wish you’d go away. Then my mommy would be just mine.”
<br><br>

Grace cooed and reached up to her older brother. “Bubba!” She squealed happily now calm from her latest melt down.
<br><br>

She held up a familiar piece of paper to him. 
<br><br>

His drawing, all scribbled over. He felt the anger rise in him till it seemed to explode. 
<br><br>

“I wish you would just disappear!”
<br><br>

All that he saw was a bolt of darkness enveloping his sister. He backed away not understanding what happened. Gracie cried, screaming really as whatever was happening in the darkness happened.
<br><br>

“Gracie!” Emily shouted before dropping a plate on the floor shattering it.<br><br>

<img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/broken-plate-13381921.jpg
" style="height:200px;float:left;margin-right:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
<br><br>

She ran to her daughter, unable to see her. She turned back to her son with a panicked look.
<br><br>

“Wetzel! Stop it! You’re hurting her!”
<br><br>

He didn’t understand what he did but he soon realized he was the one causing the darkness. He curled up into a ball. The darkness soon dispersed and an unconscious Grace laid on the floor.
<br><br>

Wetzel hadn’t meant to hurt his sister. He did though. He wanted for her to disappear. He had said it.

“Gracie!” Emily held the little girl to her chest, as she quickly called 911.<br><br>
_______________________________________________________________<br><br>

Wetzel stood outside as he watched the ambulance take his sister away, Bryce had dropped everything choosing to go with her to the hospital. Emily stayed back with her son. They needed to talk. Wetzel watched as his mother shut the door and looked at her son with an unreadable face.
<br><br>
Wetzel took off to his room, locking it behind him.<br><br>

“Wetzel. Open the door please. I just want to talk, no yelling, I promise baby.”
<br><br>

Wetzel did not respond, talking was what had gotten this to happen.
<br><br>
“Wetzel.” She shook the door handle “Wetzel, Open the door. Don’t make me get the key.”

Wetzel rushed and grabbed his school bag, dumping out all of his supplies filling it with clothes, as well money from his piggy bank and his teddy bear. He listened to his mothers footsteps as she went to retrieve the key. He quickly threw his bag out the window, him following suit as soon as his mother opened the door.
<br><br>
“Wetzel?” He made eye contact with her before dropping, grabbing his bag and running down the road.
<br><br>
Wetzel heard his mother shouting for him as well as her feet hitting the ground as she ran after him. They both knew that she had no chance of catching the small eight year old boy as he took off. <br><br>

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/p9ZkgWnZX9iAxHl9qM/giphy.gif
" style="height:200px;float:right;margin-left:20px;padding:10px;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
She stopped for a breath watching her small child run. She needed to catch him. He needed her. She needed him. They needed to stay together.
<br><br>

From the corner of her eyes she caught a familiar sight. Him. The father of her first child was standing there staring at her. His voice echoed in her head.
<br><br>

“You remember my letter, you know our child is different. He will be safe. I will watch him. Let him go. He needs to learn to control his powers. You did a good job. But things about him, you can’t help him with. The place I wrote, where I asked you to send him if he became too much. He’s going there. He will be safe, I promise…”
<br><br>

She turned back, her son's form but a dot now. She fell to the ground clutching her heart as she begged his father, Hades, to watch over him.
<br><br>

_______________________________________________________________________<br><br>
<h5 style="margin:0;font-family:courier new,monospace;font-size:9px;letter-spacing:3px;text-transform:uppercase;text-align:right;">Arrival To Camp Half-Blood </h5><br><br>

Wetzel ran for what felt like days. His tiny legs finally gave up as collapsed on the ground, his heart pounding in his chest. He didn’t want to run that far or that long but something inside of him made him feel like he couldn’t stop till he made it. Where? He didn’t know. He hadn’t even noticed he had made it to a wooded area. Trees surrounded him as he heaved lying on the ground. He didn’t even react when an older boy about thirteen to fifteen looked down at him. The boy held a spear and wore an orange shirt.
<br><br>
“Hi.”
<br><br>
Wetzel didn’t speak.
<br><br>
The older camper chuckled as he picked up the small boy as well as his bag. Wetzel saw about five more kids behind him all varying in age.
<br><br>
“Sorry guys, we need to reschedule capture of the flag, it seems we have a new camper.” 
<br><br>
Wetzel clung to the boy’s shirt.
<br><br>
___________________________________________________________________
<br><br>
One of the instructors sat with Wetzel's cell phone in hand.
<br><br>
“You don’t have to say anything but I would like to contact your guardian. Just the number.”
<br><br>
Wetzel reluctantly writes down his number on a wipe board they had given him.
<br><br>
He watched as the instructor dials the number and placed it on speaker.
<br><br>
“Hello? Wetzel? Is that you sweet boy?” Emily's voice asked. 
<br><br>
His mothers voice sounded hoarse and weak. He gave a worried look, his mother never sounded like that.
<br><br>
“Hello, my name is Hannah. I am one of the instructors of the camp. I assume you know what camp.”
<br><br>
“Yes! Is my Wetzel there? Is he okay?”
<br><br>
“Yes ma’am. A few bumps and bruises but overall okay.”
<br><br>
“Thank goodness.”
<br><br>
Wetzel heard his mother cry from the other end.
<br><br>
“May I talk to him please?” She begged.
<br><br>
The instrusteor looked down at the boy, who shook his head refusing.
<br><br>
“Forgive me ma’am but he is refusing to speak at all.”

<br><br>
“Oh…then can you hear me?”
<br><br>
“Yes, you are on speaker.”
<br><br>
“Wetzel baby, it’s okay. You’re safe there. That camp you’ll get to meet people just like you. Special people. I don’t know everything but know that you’ll be safe and learn how to control your powers. Mommy doesn’t blame you. I know you didn’t mean to hurt Gracie. Gracie is doing really good too. She woke up and the doctors say it is like nothing happened. Mommy loves you so much. And I’m so sorry. When you are ready to come home all you have to do is tell someone, and mommy will come snatch you up and bring you home. And you can call me everyday, you don’t even have to say anything, just call mommy and mommy will tell you how much I love you. Okay baby?”
<br><br>
Wetzel cried silent tears as he nodded softly. 
<br><br>
“He nodded ma’am. He understands and will take the best care of him.”
<br><br>
The instructor pulled him close, rubbing his back for reinsurance.
<br><br>
“Thank you. Um…is there anything else I need to do? Um, should I send him clothes or?”
<br><br>
“No ma’am no need. However since Wetzel is still very young and is not speaking do you mind me asking just a few questions about him. Health concerns, allergies etc.”
<br><br>
“Yes, I don’t mind.”
<br><br>
“Okay Wetzel, why don’t you take a quick nap huh?”
<br><br>

Wetzel nodded, laying down.
<br><br>
“I love you, my Wetzel.” He heard his mother say as he drifted off to sleep.

<br><br>
